//Spread Operator (...): Since map returns an Iterable of widgets, you need to use the spread operator (...) to unpack (or "spread") these widgets into the list expected by the Column widget. This allows each AnswerButton to be inserted into the Column as separate widgets.

//NOTE : the reason why we are using the following approch it's because we want to be able to generate dynamic answer widget insted of hard coding it , and the idea of making it dynamic is crucial since most of the time we're working with dynamic amount of data 

//the getShuffledAnswrs() is a method used to make a copy of a list and then shuffled it(change the order) and the reason why we're implmenting it on a copy because shuffle chnage the original list while map does not
